### ***Description***
#### **Problem #1:** Whether you live with your family, with roommates, or by yourself, keeping track of household chores can be a nightmare. This causes strain on relationships and other areas of life.
#### **Problem #2:** Too many productivity apps take away from productivity by keeping users in the setup phases for too long.
#### **Solution:** ***Chore Chart*** keeps your chores organized and up-to-date, so you can keep chore-expectations mutually understood, well delegated, and on target. ***Chore Chart*** can&rsquo;t do your chores for you &hellip; but it comes pretty close.
