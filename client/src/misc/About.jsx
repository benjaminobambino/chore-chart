      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><span className="chore-chart">Chore Chart</span> is a 
        household-sharing productivity app that I created while attending 
        General Assembly&rsquo;s full-time software engineering immersive 
        boot camp. The original idea came from my wife, who at the time was 
        pregnant with our first child and undergoing cancer treatments. In 
        such a unique situation, helpful and well-meaning people would often 
        ask, &ldquo;What can we do to help?&rdquo; The problem is, we really 
        never know how to answer that. However, with <span className="chore-chart">Chore Chart</span>
        , we can invite them to join our household and claim whatever chores 
        they would like.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, no one needs to be in a dire situation to use <span className="chore-chart">Chore Chart</span>
        . Any family or group of roommates can use <span className="chore-chart">Chore Chart</span> and 
        streamline their household&rsquo;s chore delegation, communication, and execution.
      </p>
      <p>The technologies I used in this project are React, Django, JWT Auth, and CSS.</p>
